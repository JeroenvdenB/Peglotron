# Peglotron

<p>A discord bot meant to:</p>

- create a daily prompt system, where prompts from a user-submitted database are chosen
- manage color-roles based off hex-codes, custom for each user. So none of that pre-generated lists of colors stuff! Custom all the way :D

<p>
Is the .gitignore working now?
