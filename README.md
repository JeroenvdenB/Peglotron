# Peglotron

<p>A discord bot meant to:</p>

- create a daily prompt system, where prompts from a user-submitted database are chosen
- manage color-roles based off hex-codes, custom for each user. So none of that pre-generated lists of colors stuff! Custom all the way :D

v0.0.1 - example slash commands built
v0.0.2 - open a DM to the bot
Dropped manual version control. Renamed v0.0.1 as 'slash_command_examples' and v0.0.2 as 'main'.
